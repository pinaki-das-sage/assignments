# Sage DS Assignments

All the assignments we completed as part of the sage DS program. 

## Flask App

I have tried flask to build the app this time. Flask uses a templating engine on top of HTML which provides much more flexibility compared to DCC.
Also, deploying as a multi-page app means we can keep adding to the same application and hence go around the heroku 5 apps limitation. 

I have added 3 different "types" of app in the first version. The first one uses inline code to render the page.
The second example uses OOPs to declare a class and calls it. The third one uses a static method. I will be using
the third method going forward for all assignments
